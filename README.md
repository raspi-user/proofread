# proofread

Example with Embedded HTML in Markdown Original Text:
By defining a flexible <span class="highlight-red">proof type</span> field, we allow for the inclusion of various ZKP schemes as they become available, ensuring that wallets and applications can adopt and support them over time, eventually converging on standardized formats.

Changed Line:
By defining a flexible <span class="highlight-green">proof-type</span> field, wallets and applications can adopt and support new ZKP schemes as they become available, eventually converging on standardized formats.

Reason for Change:
Improved consistency in terminology by using the hyphenated form “proof-type,” which matches the style used throughout the document.
